#Introduction to program

The idea of the program is to create an user interface that will have a timer that indicates the ammount of time the user should be doing focused work.
The user will be able to start/stop the timer and change the ammount for the timer. Later features can be added.

1/12/2023 UPDATE: Finished program, one improvment that can be made is to have a label that tracks the ammount of focused work sessions
